This program determines admissions via a mixture of criteria from exam scores of four classes and one admission exam score. Students are ranked on a singular or composite score for each department, for example chemistry and physics for the biochemistry department. For all departments, all students are ranked via scores and the student's top 3 priority departments, and only the top `n` students are saved to `<department>.txt` files.
